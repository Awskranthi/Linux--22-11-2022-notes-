Kernel: The kneral is the interface between the application and the actual process done ate the Hardware level .
Tasks peformend by the kernel 1)resources Allocation :-Manage he computers resources and allow other programs to run and use these resources ,
2)security Managment: provided the security and protection from faults and maliicious behaviours,
process management: allows the execution of application and suport tem with feacturesuch as hardware abstraction.
device management:maintains a list of available devicesand allow drives to physically acess their devices .
scheduling:gives every program specific amount of thime and can stwic from one process to another .
Memory Managment: Allows process to safty aess the memory according to their requriments.
SHELL:The shell is the IINTERFACE which takes USERCOMMAND and sends It to the KERNEL.she has got its own programmng languae and yo can combine mulitiple commands in asingle script,The shell taked the commands in human readable fromant and provides its to Kernel in bnary language.The user generally intracts via shell ,but direct interction with hardware is also possible,the first shell created was Sh for Unix  system ,Linux still provide support for Sh shell, but Bash is more popular with in the Linux users .
APPLICATION------SHELL------KERNEL-----HARDWARE(DEVICE, CPU,MEMORY)
How Shell Works?:-The command to be Executed or shell script ------Linux shell---------Converted to binary lang by Shell -----sent to Linux Kernel 
example :grep,awk,cat------BASH------10110000,10001100,00110011----------Linux Kernel .
